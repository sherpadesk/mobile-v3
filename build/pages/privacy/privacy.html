              <p class="margin-top0">When you register for a SherpaDesk trial you can be certain that we have implemented comprehensive security practices to ensure that only you and those people you provide authorized access to can see your help desk. We respect your right to privacy and feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via our website at http:www.sherpadesk.com (the “Site”) and through our on-demand support platform, tools and services offered on the Site (the “Service”).</p>
              <h4>Information you Provide</h4>
              <p class="margin-top0">When you register for the Service, we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, company name and address. bigWebApps uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on bigWebApps behalf.</p>
              <p class="margin-top0">bigWebApps practice is not to use such personal information for marketing purposes. bigWebApps may use the collected personal information and other information bigWebApps collects about your use of the Service to operate and make the Service available to you, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact you about your use of the Service, research purposes and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and Site.</p>
              <p>bigWebApps may also transmit or share your personal information with its third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the Service, which may require that your personal information be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of bigWebApps and the authorized third parties referred to here.

Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. SherpaDesk uses persistent cookies that only SherpaDesk can read and use, to identify you as a SherpaDesk customer and make it easier for you to log in to the Service. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.</p>
              <h4>Information Sharing</h4>

We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. bigWebApps may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p>
